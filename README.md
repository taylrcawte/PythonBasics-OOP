# PythonBasics-OOP
A simple repository showcasing some object oriented programming; this repository has a pseudo dungeons and drags type game with some funny banter 

The main.py houses the script to run the game while the enemy.py file has all the enemy classes, the hero.py has the hero classes, and the encounter.py has the rules for engaging in a fight. 

The IPYNB is easier to use/play online. 

Just a small fun way to showcase some inheritance and composition in object oriented python.
